## Starting Items
1. 600 Gold Starting
2. Use spells straight away for optimal use of mana
3. Potential Items - Magic Sticks
4. Tangos - Allows you to trade in the lane straight away
5. Healing Salve - For your carry to be more risky
6. Starting with a Sentry ward(Not with courier) helps you secure your pull
7. Mangos or Tangos or Sentry Ward
8. This decision deponds on the three decisions - 
  i. Stack your pull - Sentry Ward
  ii. Static Laning Phase - Securing the lane for your carry (Mangos or Tangos)
9. High burst Lane - Mars + Lina - Fluffy Hat ( Allows you to not fall into the threshold that doesn't allow to be one shotted)
10. Very Draw out sustain lane - Lot of spell casting - Ring of basilius
11. Most commong regen items - 6 Tanogs, 2 Branches, 1 Salve, 2 Mangos, 1 Faerie Fire
12. In some games, up against position 4 that wants to pull creeps - Buy boots to chase down the hero and attack(forces him to use a salve)
13. Also buy boots, to help mid hero secure his runes (actively running)
14. Ranged Hero vs Melee Hero (Melee should try taking boots)
15. Conclusion - 
  i. Always try choosing the right starting items
  ii. Analyze your starting items after every game
  iii. Watch pro replays and learn from the pro replays.

## Laning Phase
1. Pulling
2. Unstacked Small Camp
3. The camp won't kill the entire creep wave when this happens, we stack 2 creep waves and push the opponents tower
4. It gives one free creep wave for our carry
5. Single Pull - Results in a large creep wave ( Can use it to your advantage but last hitting might be little hard)
6. Some lanes might require this unstack single camp pull
7. Hard camp can be used when your wave is pushed out as a result of the single pull
8. Hard Camp Timings - Always pull at 27 - 30 Seconds and 57-60 Seconds
9. Small Camp Timings - 17-20 Seconds
10. Pull Hard Camp and time the death of the small camp to chain the pull if uncontested but very hard
11. You can abuse these camps without even being in the lane
12. You can pull half waves depending on camps that spawn
13. One stacked small camp can almost deny 2 and half creep waves
14. The small camp is your friend, always stack and pull it ( you can deny waves and xp for your enemies)
15. Another Chaotic Setup
    i. Single Pull Small Camp (Hit Neutral Creeps to time your current wave to meet the next wave)
    ii. Have huge creep wave fighting against enemy wave 
    iii. This gives enough room for your to pull the hard camp on to your next wave
    iv. You will also have a small camp for the next wave too
    v. This will make it very chaotic and give a lot of free creeps to your carry
    vi. Use this in losing lanes to create chaos and freak out the balance
