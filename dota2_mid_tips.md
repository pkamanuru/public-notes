## Pre Laning Setup
1. Setup First Ward
   * Vision on Rune
   * Vision on Rotation (On the side where support rotates)
   * Could be even on the hill(towards safe lane) without vision on the rune
2. Block your creeps, Lock your screen on your hero
   * Radiant Stand on the right side which will force creeps to go the left side
   * Nothing special on the dire side
   * Consider using edge pan while blocking
4. You are Melee against Ranged (Block is super important)
5. If you can get first kill on the bounty runes you can choose not to block
6. Also, if the opponent is not blocking stop the block immediately (Swinging Lanes)
7. Lanes like Ember vs Viper (You can't outlane viper, the lane is swingy)
8. Understand your Lane
   * Dominate the Lane
   * Survive
   * Going Even
   * Lina vs TA (Even)
   * Viper vs Ember (Viper wants to dominate)
9. For Survive Lanes (Disrupt the Lane Equilibrium)
   * You could only have a few small wins
   * Taking His Bounty
   * Ruining Lane Control
   * Stacking your own small camp

## Laning Phase

2. Try getting the lane on your high ground as much as possible
3. After 5 Minutes
    * Night
    * Bounty Runes 
4.  Always get boots before you start rotating
