## Pre Laning Setup
1. Setup First Ward
   * Vision on Rune
   * Vision on Rotation (On the side where support rotates)
   * Could be even on the hill(towards safe lane) without vision on the rune
2. Block your creeps, Lock your screen on your hero
   * Radiant Stand on the right side which will force creeps to go the left side
   * Nothing special on the dire side
   * Consider using edge pan while blocking
4. You are Melee against Ranged (Block is super important)
5. If you can get first kill on the bounty runes you can choose not to block
6. Also, if the opponent is not blocking stop the block immediately (Swinging Lanes)
7. Lanes like Ember vs Viper (You can't outlane viper, the lane is swingy)
8. Understand your Lane
   * Dominate the Lane
   * Survive
   * Going Even
   * Lina vs TA (Even)
   * Viper vs Ember (Viper wants to dominate)
9. For Survive Lanes (Disrupt the Lane Equilibrium)
   * You could only have a few small wins
   * Taking His Bounty
   * Ruining Lane Control
   * Stacking your own small camp

## Starting Items
1. Some matches Rush Bottle
2. Some matches Health Regen (Trading More)
3. Some matches Clarity (Push all and Farm)
4. QOP vs Void Spirit
  * Tango, Feirie Fire, Branch, Branch, Circlet
  * Tango, Feirie Fire, Branch, Branch, Circlet, Quelling Blade
  * Both are Spell Heavy Heroes
  * Both want Bottle Right Away ( 2 Min Rune )
  * If bottle is focus Don't upgrade Circlet to Null Talisman
  * You don't want buy anymore regen and bottle the 2 min rune
  * Circle always helps you upgrade
      * Null Talisman
      * Bracer
      * Wraith Band
5. If you don't want  Null Talisman, Bracer or a Wraith Band
   * Tango, Feirie Fire, 3 Branches, Ward (Bat Rider)
   * Quelling Blade, Branch, Tango, Feirie Fire, Stick
6. 
7. Bat Rider
  * Feirie, 2 Branches, Tango 
  * Heros who need push out waves, clear the creeps, and are rune dependent, Don't buy circlets
8. Against Spammers (Bat Rider, Storm Spirit, Bristle Back)
  * Buy a Stick
  * Then, finish the circlet to null talisman
  * before going to a bottle due to regen from the stick can be sufficient
9. Some instance it's good to buy a quelling blade on a ranged hero
  * Visage vs Invoker
  * Exort invoker - At Level 3 Invoker has a high damage
  * Go for Blightstone + Quelling blade on Visage for high damage
  * Only Visage or Bat Rider Ranged heroes go for a quelling blade 
10. As a rule of thumb always buy a Quelling blade on a Melee hero


## Laning Phase
1. Stacking Small Camps
  * Any Hero that has a long range nuke
    * Lina
    * Puck
    * Void Spirit
    * Vengeful Sprit
    * Bat Rider
2. Try getting the lane on your high ground as much as possible
3. Using Spells to Last Hit your own ranged creep and denying
4. After 5 Minutes
    * Night
    * Bounty Runes 
5.  Always get boots before you start rotating
6.  Whenever you have a Roaming pos4, you could try to keep your enemy on 60-70% HP
7.  Dealing with Bad Matchups
   * Small Camp is your best friend
   * Even enemy Small Camp
8. When getting a Rune for Regen Efficiency
   * Backpack your stat items for max efficiency

## Wave Manipulation in Mid Lane
1. When to push the wave ?
  * Water Rune
  * Gank
  * Bounty Rune
2. When to Keep it stable ?
  * More Harass you have, more stable it should be
3. When to have the Lane Swinging ?
  * High Range Hero
  * High Harass lane as you are melee (Use your spells as much as possible)
  * Ideally hit both Enemy Hero and Range Creep
