### 1. What it means to be an offlane ? 
  * Least Farm Priority among the cores
  * Generally stronger than the other 2 cores early in the game
  * You have to be creating space until the other cores come online
  * You end up being a support near the end game
  * Initiate First, give vision
  * Most common mistake - fallback and become passive
  * Being passive is the job of the other cores mostly
  * As a position 3, take control, setup moves, be in the front line
  * TP or Run Home, Try Full Regennned as much as possible
